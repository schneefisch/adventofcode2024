# adventofcode2024
This repository contains my solutions for the
[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

Similar to last year, my personal approach is to solve the puzzles using
* GoLang
* Test-Driven-Development (TDD)

In addition I want to use this repository to learn more about GoLang.
As a side-effect I will also note down the time the tests take to run on the different puzzles so maybe this can be 
compared to other languages or implementations.
This will only count the test execution time for the main input data and not the example-data.
I'm running these tests on a MacBook Pro 2021 with an Apple M1 Max processor and the IntelliJ IDEA IDE.
